# Express Vercel React Starter

## Summary
Deploying an application is never easy. While Vercel has simplified the steps, deploying one to it with both server- and client-side code complicates things a little. And if you use a framework like Vite, even more so. This repository makes it easier to deploy right away so you can get coding.

## Steps
- `git clone https://github.com/samuraijane/express-vercel-react-starter.git`
- `git remote set-url origin <your-repo-url>`
- `git push origin main`
- Log in to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- Add a new project
- Authorize Vercel to see your repository in GitHub and select it
- Click _Import_ to pull the code from GitHub into Vercel
- Click _Deploy_
- Navigate to the URL created by Vercel (e.g. _<your-repo-name>.vercel.app_)
- Start coding - each time you push to `main`, Vercel will build your application and redeploy it
